            <p class>I am a musician and play in a band with my wife. Together we started, and are directors of, a non-profit called Mission Love. I am a creative problem solver who likes to think outside the box. Aside from music I enjoy creating things out of wood and metal. My greatest joy in life are my two sons who are the center of my world..
            I am a detail oriented software developer with a passion for clean coding standards. I graduated from We Can Code IT Bootcamp in 2022. Along with being a self-motivated, natural leader, I have 10+ years of experience in management.
            In 2021 I decided to transition out of a job that had no opportunity for advancement. In deciding what direction I was going to take, I rediscovered my passion for creating with software and found We Can Code IT software development bootcamp. I learned a lot before attending the bootcamp, and a great deal more from the bootcamp itself. I feel that my previous management and problem solving experience will be an asset in my career as a software developer.
